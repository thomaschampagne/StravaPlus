***************************************************************************************************************************
__StraTistiX__  is my fork (https://github.com/KamensekD/StraTistiX) based on Thomas Champagne's __StravistiX__ Strava Chrome Plugin.
I add/change some functionalities that are based on my ideas and preferences that suit me; they might or might not suit You and/or Thomas. I also try to fix bugs found and might also introduce some new :)
I developed and designed aRPEe Score concept. It is based on lots of my workouts and mostly seems to  acurately describe how hard my workouts were.
I'll try to merge new stuff from his base repository into this; anyone can also take anything from my repository and use it freely; if using aRPEe Score, please just link to this repository; most kudos for this plugin go to Thomas Champagne!!!

If You're having trouble using sources from GitHub to install the plugin to Chrome, I made it available in Chrome Web Store:
