This estimation is more meaningfull than <i>Estimated Average Power</i>. Why? While average power simply takes all of the samples of estimated power and divides them by the number of samples, <i>Estimated Weighted Power</i> uses a tricky weighting system to come up with a number that is more in line with the true physiological effort for your given activity.<br/><br/><i>Weighted Power</i> is basically the power that you could have maintainted for the same physiological "cost" if your power output had been constant.<br/><br/><i>Weighted Power</i> is calculated from an algorithm introduced by Dr. Andy Coggan to weight this variability according to its physiological difficulty. Here\'s the formula: <br/><br/><img src="img/np_equation.png" /><br /><br />Remember that <i>Estimated Weighted Power</i> is an estimation because it\'s based on <i>Estimated Average Power</i> !<br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; ">Variability Index:</strong><br /><br />Variability Index is an indication of how your activity was paced. This indication shows how smooth or evenly paced the power output was during a race or work out. Basically Variability Index is <i>Weighted Power</i> over <i>Average watts</i><br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; ">Punch Factor:</strong><br /><br />Although <i>Weighted Power</i> is a better measure of training intensity than average power, it does not take into account differences in fitness within or between individuals. Therefore StravistiX introduce an <strong>Punch Factor</strong> (PF) for every activity. <br/><br/><strong>Punch Factor</strong> is simply the ratio of the <i>Weighted Power</i> as above over your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) (entered in health settings). <br/><br />For example, if your <i>Weighted Power</i> for a long training ride done early in the year is 210 W and your threshold power at the time is 280 W, then the PF for that workout would be 0.75. However, if you did that same exact ride later in the year after your threshold power had risen to 300 W, then the PF would be lower, i.e., 0.70. <strong>Punch Factor</strong> therefore provides a valid and convenient way of comparing the relative intensity of a training session or race either within or between riders, taking into account changes or differences in threshold power. <br/><br /> Typical <strong>Punch Factor</strong> values for various training sessions or races are as follows: <br /><br/> Less than 0.75 are recovery rides <br /><br/> 0.75-0.85 endurance-paced training rides <br /><br/> 0.85-0.95 tempo rides, aerobic and anaerobic interval workouts (work and rest periods combined), longer (>2.5 h) road races <br/><br /> 0.95-1.05 lactate threshold intervals (work period only), shorter (<2.5 h) road races, criteriums, circuit races, longer (e.g., 40 km) Tts <br/><br /> 1.05-1.15 shorter (e.g., 15 km) TTs, track points race <br /><br/> Greater than 1.15 prologue TT, track pursuit, track miss-and-o;<br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; ">Weighted Watts / Kg:</strong><br /><br />"Weighted Watts / Kg" is basically an estimation of the power per Killogram that you could have maintainted for the same physiological "cost" if your power output had been constant<br/></br>That\'s simply your <i>Weighted Power</i> over your weight + <strong>bike</strong> in Kg. <br/> <br/><strong style="font-size: 18px; ">Quartiles and median</strong> <br/> <br/>For understanding these indicators, we assume that 0% to 100% are all the heart rates sorted ascending you obtained during an activity. <br/> <br/> <strong>25% Quartile:</strong>This indicator represents the power you maintained at the position "25%".

Good reading...</strong><br/> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 18px; "><u>TR</u>aining <u>IMP</u>ulse or TRIMP</strong><br/><br/>Represents the amount of heart stress during an activity. The longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE !! So go outside suffer for twelve hours! Or stay here to understand what it returns... <i>TRIMP</i> is a way to model the human athletic performance. This concept has been introduced by Dr Eric Banister. <br/> <br/>Ok, Cool... But how this works?! <br/> <br/>StravistiX computes <i>TRIMP</i> on activities using the most sophisticated approach: <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> which use your <i>Heart Rate Reserve or HRR</i>. <i>HRR</i> is basically your heart effort level according to your heart capacity . <br/> <br/>What are all these terms?! Don\'t panic... Here is an explanation from a Math view (you may hate that, sorry...). <br/> <br/> <img src="img/trimp_equation.png" /> <br/> <br/>Where&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/kMen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Mens) &nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/kWomen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Womens) <br/> <br/>And <i>HRR = Heart Rate Reserve = Heart effort level according to heart capacity</i> defined by <br/> <br/> <img src="img/hrr_equation.png" /> <br/> <br/>According this <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> formula, the longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE ! <br/> <br/>But this heart score seems to be <i>Strava Suffer Score</i>?! Not really... <i>Strava Suffer Score</i> is only inspired by the TRIMP concept. However the idea is same and both score are correlated. <br/> <br/>Need more infos? Then read more about <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Heart_Rate_Reserve" target="_blank">HRR here</a> and <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/TRIMP" target="_blank">TRIMP here</a> <br/> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 18px; ">%Heart Rate Reserve Average</strong><br/><br/>Represents the stress level reached during an activity according to your heart capacity.

It\'s impossible... But try to get the higher percentage ;) You will get a better <i>TRIMP</i> score in the same way. <br/> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 18px; ">%Heart Rate Reserve Zones Distribution Graph</strong><br/> <br/>To display this graph you need heart rate data on your activity.<br/><br/><img src="img/hrr_graph.png" /> <br/> <br/>No explanations anymore about this...
