		<h2 class="mat-headline">The basics</h2>
		In simple terms, the fitness trend is a kind of "black box system" that modelizes the response of your body
		exposed to various efforts performed over time. Your body reacts to these solicitations with "fatigue" and
		creates a "background fitness base" that makes you "stronger" for the subsequent efforts. To use fully the
		acquired fitness you have to be in "form" meaning that you have overcomed tiredness by taking rest.

		To put numbers on fitness, fatigue and form over time, each effort has to be quantified. This is where "stress
		scores" are used.<br/><br/>

		There exists several recognized stress scores calculation methods depending on available sensors. These stress
		scores are detailed in a further section.

		<ul>
			<li>
				Using a Heart Rate Monitor:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Training Impulse (TRIMP)</i>. Represents a training load based on your heart activity.
						Depends on exercise duration and intensity.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Heart Rate Stress Score (HRSS)</i>. Based on <i>TRIMP</i>, <i>HRSS</i> also represents a
						training load from heart rate data. <i>HRSS</i> is more accurate than <i>TRIMP</i>
						since it take care of user <i>Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)</i>. In few words, <i>LTHR</i>
						is the best average heart rate that an athlete can maintain for up to an hour. <i>LTHR</i> is
						configurable in athlete settings. <i>HRSS</i> is close to <i>HrTSS&reg;</i> from
						TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Using a Cycling Power Meter:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Power Stress Score (PSS)</i>. Calculated from workout's power, the moving duration and
						athlete <i>Cycling Functional Threshold Power (FTP)</i>. <i>FTP</i> is configurable in athlete
						settings. <i>PSS</i> is equivalent to <i>TSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Without sensors (e.g. smartphone or GPS only):
				<ul>
					<li><i>Swimming Stress Score (SSS)</i>: Calculated from workout moving duration, distance and
						athlete <i>Swimming Functional Threshold Pace (SFTP)</i>. <i>SFTP</i> is configurable in athlete
						settings. <i>SSS</i> is equivalent to <i>sTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Estimated Power Stress Score (PSS)</i>: Same as <i>Power Stress Score (PSS)</i> described
						above but calculation of <i>PSS</i> is performed on estimated power data.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Running Stress Score (RSS)</i>: Calculated from workout moving duration, activity grade
						adjusted pace (GAP) and athlete <i>Running Functional Threshold Pace (RFTP)</i>. <i>RFTP</i> is
						configurable in athlete settings. <i>RSS</i> is equivalent to <i>rTSS&reg;</i> from
						TrainingPeaks&trade;
					</li>
				</ul>

		Each activity with a stress score may be related to an "impulse" causing its own amount of fatigue and fitness.
		An impulse amplitude is directly correlated to the stress score value: high stress score provides high impulse
		amplitude.<br/><br/>

		Next, the job of the fitness trend "black box" is to provide a view of your <i>Fatigue</i>, <i>Fitness</i> and
		<i>Form</i> over time based on your given impulses.<br/><br/>

		<h2 class="mat-headline">Understanding modelization of fitness, fatigue and form</h2>

		The modelization admits that each effort results in an amount of <i>Fatigue</i> and <i>Fitness</i> and the
		generated <i>Fatigue</i> is greater than acquired <i>Fitness</i>. Basically <i>Fatigue</i> is quite easy to
		explain. It's the tiredness which limits your performance. <i>Fitness</i> is the foundations, the potential
		availability of the athlete. An athlete can't get into big workouts or races without a minimum of fitness
		acquired. When resting, both fatigue and fitness are eliminated over days. The difference is that fatigue is
		lost faster than fitness.<br/><br/>

		This implies that <i>Fitness</i> can be higher than <i>Fatigue</i> on some periods. Since modelization also
		admits that athlete's <i>Form</i> is globally the difference between <i>Fitness</i> and <i>Fatigue</i>. In that
		case, it's a sign of a "freshness" <i>Form</i>. This state can be targeted by athletes for races or big days.
		Also, the <i>Fitness</i> can be lower than <i>Fatigue</i> it-self. It isn't necessary a sign of abnormal
		training. If difference is reasonable, athlete is probably in an "optimal" <i>Form</i> to build a solid fitness.
		However if <i>Fitness</i> is <strong>too low</strong> compared to <i>Fatigue</i> (difference is too high),
		athlete can reach an over-training <i>Form</i>. Athlete should consider rest at this point. These "limits" are
		covered in details through a <strong>training zones</strong> section below.<br/><br/>

		Modelization of fitness, fatigue and form is calculated using athlete stress scores impulses. Here is how
		impulses are mathematically processed:

		<div class="maths-area">
			<katex
				[expression]="'Fitness_{(day)} = Fitness_{(day - 1)} + (StressScore_{(day)} - Fitness_{(day - 1)})~\\times~(1-e^{-1 / 42})'"></katex>
			<br/>
			<katex
				[expression]="'Fatigue_{(day)} = Fatigue_{(day - 1)} + (StressScore_{(day)} - Fatigue_{(day - 1)})~\\times~(1-e^{-1 / 7})'"></katex>
			<br/>
			<katex [expression]="'Form_{(day)} = Fitness_{(day - 1)} - Fatigue_{(day - 1)}'"></katex>
		</div>

		<h2 class="mat-headline">Using training zones</h2>

		As explained in previous section, the athlete's <i>Form</i> is the difference between <i>Fitness</i> and
		<i>Fatigue</i>:<br/><br/>

		<katex [expression]="'Form = Fitness - Fatigue'"></katex>
		<br/><br/>

		A <i>Training Zone</i> is defined by a range of <i>Form</i> values and <i>Training Zones</i> can be: Transition
		zone, Freshness,
		Neutral, Optimal and Over-Training. So, a <i>Form</i> value can be associated to a particular <i>Training
		Zone</i>.<br/><br/>

		Depending on the <i>Form</i> value, you can manage and plan your training to reach or avoid a particular
		zone. So when:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li><i>+25 < Form :</i> Transition zone. Athlete is on form. Case where athlete has an
				extended break. (e.g. illness, injury or end of the season).
			</li>
			<li><i>+5 < Form < +25 :</i> Freshness Zone. Athlete is on form. Ready for a race or big day(s).</li>
			<li><i>-10 < Form < +5 :</i> Neutral Zone. Zone reached typically when athlete is in a rest
				or recovery week. After a race or hard training period.
			</li>
			<li><i>-30 < Form < -10 :</i> Optimal Training Zone. Where athlete can build an effective fitness.</li>
			<li><i>Form < -30 :</i> Over Load Zone. Athlete is on overload or over-training phase. He should
				take a rest!
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="mat-headline">Stress scores explained</h2>

		This section includes some mathematics formulas. They can help some of you to a deeper understanding.
		If mathematics are not your friend, just close your eyes on: explanations are understandable without formulas.

		<h1 class="mat-title">Training Impulse (TRIMP)</h1>

		<div>
			The <i>Training Impulse</i> stress score represents a training load based on your heart rate activity during
			an effort. It provides a good indicator to compare commitment between activities. It applies to all workout
			types since you hold an heart rate monitor. <i>TRIMP</i> takes into consideration the duration and the
			intensity of exercise as calculated by the <i>Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)</i>. The <i>Heart Rate Reserve</i> is
			a heart effort level according to a heart capacity. It is defined by:<br/>

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'HRR=\\frac{HR~-~HR_{rest}}{HR_{max}~-~HR_{rest}}'"></katex>
			</div>

			And <i>Training Impulse</i> is defined the below formula:<br/>

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex
					[expression]="'Training Impulse = \\displaystyle\\sum_{t=0_{min}}^t{\\delta t~\\times~HRR~\\times~0.64^{k~\\times~HRR}}~~where~~k=1.92~~(for~mens)~~~or~~~k=1.67~~(for~womens)'"></katex>
			</div>

			You can set the <i>TRIMP</i> as default heart rate stress score calculation method in the fitness trend.
			However:

			<ul>
				<li>
					Training Zones will be disabled because <i>TRIMP</i> scores are not optimized to be use with
					Training Zones.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cycling Power Stress Scores (PSS) will not be used because <i>TRIMP</i> scores compared to PSS
					scores is not fully reliable.
				</li>
				<li>
					Swimming Stress Scores (SSS) will not be used because <i>TRIMP</i> scores compared to SSS scores is
					not fully reliable.
				</li>
			</ul>

			The <i>Heart Rate Stress Score (HRSS)</i> described below is highly recommended instead.

		</div>

		<h1 class="mat-title">Heart Rate Stress Score (HRSS)</h1>

		<div>
			<i>HRSS</i> also represents a training load based on your heart rate activity. It is based on <i>TRIMP</i>
			behind. That's why <i>HRSS</i> depends also on exercise duration and intensity.<br/><br/>

			The major difference with <i>TRIMP</i> is that <i>HRSS</i> is based on athlete's <i>Lactate Threshold Heart
			Rate (LTHR)</i>. <i>LTHR</i> is the point, above which, increased blood acidification occurs in your body.
			Above this threshold your endurance performance will rapidly decrease. Basically it's the latest best
			average heart rate you can maintain for up to an hour. You can setup your own LTHR in athlete settings.<br/><br/>

			<i>HRSS</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex
					[expression]="'HRSS = \\frac{Activity~Trimp}{OneHourTrimp@LTHR}~\\times~100'"></katex>
				<br/><br/>

				<katex
					[expression]="'Where~~OneHourTrimp@LTHR = 60min~\\times~HRR@LTHR~\\times~0.64^{k~\\times~HRR@LTHR}'"></katex>
				<br/><br/>
				<katex
					[expression]="'And~~HRR@LTHR = \\frac{LTHR~-~HR_{rest}}{HR_{max}~-~HR_{rest}}~~and~~k=1.92~~(for~mens)~~~or~~~k=1.67~~(for~womens)'"></katex>
			</div>

			You should use <i>HRSS</i> as default heart rate stress score calculation method in the fitness trend
			instead of <i>TRIMP</i>.
			Because it allows a right use of <i>Training Zones</i> and comparison with others stress scores.<br/><br/>

			Note that <i>HRSS</i> is close to <i>HrTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;

		</div>

		<h1 class="mat-title">Power Stress Score (PSS)</h1>
		<div>
			<i>Power Stress Score</i> is a stress score designed for cyclists having a power meter. It is the more
			accurate of all. The <i>PSS</i> is calculated from the duration of the workout, the athlete's <i>Functional
			Threshold Power (FTP)</i> and the

			<i>Intensity</i>.<br/><br/>

			<i>Intensity</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'Intensity=\\frac{WeigthedPower}{FTP}'"></katex>
			</div>

			Where <i>Weighted Power</i> is the average power that you could have maintained for the same physiological
			cost if your power output had been constant. It is also called <i>Normalized Power (NP&reg;)</i> in
			TrainingPeaks&trade;.<br/><br/>

			<i>Weighted Power</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'WeightedPower = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\sum(powerSample^4/count(powerSample))}}'"></katex>
			</div>

			To conclude <i>Power Stress Score</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex
					[expression]="'PSS=\\frac{EffortInSeconds~\\times~WeigthedPower~\\times~Intensity}{FTP~\\times~3600}~\\times~100'"></katex>
			</div>

			Note that <i>PSS</i> is equivalent to <i>TSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;

		</div>

		<h1 class="mat-title">Estimated Power Stress Score (PSS)</h1>

		<div>
			Same as <i>Power Stress Score (PSS)</i> described above but calculation of <i>PSS</i> is performed on
			estimated power data.
		</div>

		<h1 class="mat-title">Swimming Stress Score (SSS)</h1>

		<div>
			No surprise the <i>Swimming Stress Score</i> is designed for swimming activities. In prerequisites you have
			to set your <i>Swimming Functional Threshold Pace (SFTP)</i> in athlete settings.
			There is no need to wear a swimming heart rate monitor. Workout distance and active swimming time are the
			only required to compute the <i>SSS</i>. If your watch supports indoor and/or outdoor swimming, it's all
			good. Else if you have a simple waterproof stopwatch you need to know the distance of your workout and the
			time of active swimming without rest periods (before entering your manual entry in Strava).<br/><br/>

			<i>Swimming Stress Score</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'Swim Stress Score=Intensity^3~\\times~TotalTimeInHours~\\times~100'"></katex>
			</div>

			With Intensity defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'Intensity=\\frac{Normalized Swim Speed}{Swim FTP}'"></katex>
			</div>

			And Normalized Swim Speed defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex
					[expression]="'Normalized Swim Speed=\\frac{DistanceInMeters}{Time In Minutes Without Rest}'"></katex>
			</div>

			Note that <i>SSS</i> is equivalent to <i>sTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
		</div>

		<h1 class="mat-title">Running Stress Score (RSS)</h1>

		<div>
			The <i>Running Stress Score</i> is an estimated stress score for runners. It can be used as stress score
			input for fitness trend when athlete don't own (or forgot) heart rate monitor. In prerequisites you have
			to set your Running Functional Threshold Pace (RFTP) in athlete settings to access this stress score.
			<br/><br/>

			<i>Running Stress Score</i> is defined by:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex
					[expression]="'RSS=\\frac{EffortInSeconds~\\times~GradeAdjustedPace~\\times~Intensity}{Running FTP~\\times~3600}~\\times~100'"></katex>
			</div>

			Where <i>Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP)</i> is a estimation of the equivalent flat land pace for a given running
			pace on hilly terrain. (Running uphill requires more effort than running on a flat grade, so GAP adjusts
			pace
			to be faster than the actual running pace. Similarly, GAP is slower than actual pace on downhill
			terrain).<br/><br/>

			And Intensity is:

			<div class="maths-area">
				<katex [expression]="'Intensity=\\frac{GAP}{Running FTP}'"></katex>
			</div>

			Note that <i>RSS</i> is equivalent to <i>rTSS&reg;</i> from TrainingPeaks&trade;
		</div>
